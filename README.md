# Loan Default Detection - Loan Approval

This is the first machine learning project I completed in 2021, focusing on assisting financial institutions in determining whether to approve loan applications. The goal is to help banks enhance their profit margins while minimizing risk exposure.

**Dataset in use:** [Credit Card Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mishra5001/credit-card)

## Project Overview

I developed and evaluated several machine learning models to predict loan defaults, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Bagging
- Boosting
- Ridge Regression
- Elastic Net
- Decision Tree
- Lasso Regression

Among these, **Lasso Regression** performed the best, achieving an accuracy of 80.79% on the training set and 82.48% on the testing set. 

### Key Performance Metrics

- **Approved and Did Not Default (Profit):** 932 people
- **Approved and Defaulted (Loss):** 155 people
- **Rejected and Would Not Default (Opportunity Cost):** 167 people

The results indicate that Lasso Regression not only provided the highest accuracy but also optimized the bank's profitability by correctly identifying the most creditworthy applicants.

## Conclusion

This machine learning model can significantly assist financial institutions in making more informed loan approval decisions, thereby boosting profitability and reducing the likelihood of defaults.
